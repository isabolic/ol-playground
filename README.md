OpenLayers playground

OpenLayers example of custom control:
- Draw Arch
- Edit Arch
- Intersect  (select two or more feature and display the intersect point)
- Scale Feature (select feature and by pull resize the feature)

I plan to migrate to OL3 and develop in new feature other controls.
Also the documentation will be written in the new future.
example is here so you can see:
